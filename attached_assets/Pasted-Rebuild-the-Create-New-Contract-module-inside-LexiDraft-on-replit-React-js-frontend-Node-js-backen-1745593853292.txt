Rebuild the Create New Contract module inside LexiDraft on replit (React.js frontend, Node.js backend). The goal is to create a full-flow, AI-enhanced, legally structured, editable contract system with built-in client sync, document personalization, AI mail drafting, and visual WYSIWYG PDF contract editing. Use existing modules like user dashboard, client portal, and share link system without disruption.”

PHASE 1: Smart Contract Creation Flow
📍 Step 1: Select Contract Type
Dropdown: NDA, Founder Agreement, Freelance, Employment, etc.


Show category-based suggestions


📍 Step 2: Add Parties (Dynamic Field)
Input fields: Party Name, Role, Jurisdiction


“+ Add Party” button to dynamically include multiple clients


📍 Step 3: Interactive Prompt Interface
Instead of rigid form, use chat-style dynamic prompt capture


Use LLM to ask relevant follow-up based on contract type


Example:


 “What is the duration of this agreement?”
 “Any advance payment mentioned?”



Store all collected values in structured JSON behind the scenes


Lexi AI Suggestions: Auto-recommend previously saved clause data from user history
